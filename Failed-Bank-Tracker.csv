The entire operation will cost the State €3.7 billion. This amount breaks down into €2.2 billion in new capital injections, €0.8 billion to be written off from the earlier aid package, and €0.7 billion to put the real estate portfolio at arm's length. Furthermore, the State will extend €1.1 billion in loans plus guarantees worth €5 billion. As a result, the EMU balance 2013 of the Netherlands will deteriorate by 0.6% while EMU debt will increase by 1.6%.",Dutch Government,http://www.government.nl/news/2013/02/01/state-of-the-netherlands-nationalises-sns-reaal.html,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Netherlands,Amsterdam,,
2013-01-25,,Sparekassen Lolland (Denmark) ,0,"Denmark's second biggest bank Jyske Bank has agreed to take over Sparekassen Lolland after the unlisted rival failed to meet the financial watchdog's solvency requirements, the banks said on Friday. Denmark has the most fragmented banking industry in the Nordic region with more than 100 banks and many in the industry are predicting further consolidation in the wake of the financial crisis. The two banks said on Friday that the country's financial services regulator had concluded after an inspection that Sparekassen Lolland needed to make further loan impairment charges and provisions for guarantees. As a result Sparekassen Lolland said it would be impossible to meet its solvency requirements within the time allowed. ""Consequently, it is not possible for Sparekassen Lolland to continue as an independent financial institution,"" Jyske Bank said. The FSA had set a deadline for the bank of Sunday, Jan 27 at 0500 GMT to meet the minimum capital solvency requirement of 8 percent of assets. Jyske Bank will take over all of Sparekassen Lolland's customers, assets and liabilities, except for share capital and subordinated capital, it said in the statement. The take-over comprises all 45,000 customers of Sparekassen Lolland's branches and 70,000 customers of online bank FinansNetbanken. The bank's balance sheet amounts to 12.9 billion Danish crowns ($2.33 billion) while loans and advances total 7.1 billion crowns and deposits 9.7 billion crowns.",0,http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/25/us-jyskebank-idUSBRE90O0ZE20130125,"Lolland, Denmark",Denmark,Lolland,55.67631,12.569355
2012-11-06,,Toender Bank (DK),0," Toender Bank A/S, which declared bankruptcy on Nov. 2 after an inspection by the Financial Supervisory Authority revealed impairments big enough to wipe out the regional lender’s equity, was guilty of a “massive misrepresentation” of its financial health that more rigorous scrutiny wouldn’t have uncovered earlier, FSA Director General Ulrik Noedgaard said.  “It’s massive non-compliance with the laws and regulations, and we can never be 100 percent sure that this won’t happen again,” Noedgaard, whose office is based in Copenhagen, said in an interview yesterday. After going over the accounts of 90 of Denmark’s roughly 105 banks, “we haven’t seen anything like this before,” he said.  More than a dozen regional lenders have collapsed since Denmark’s housing bubble burst in 2008, threatening to push the nation into its second recession in less than a year. The International Monetary Fund said Nov. 5 that the FSA should broaden its oversight of Denmark’s regional lenders and even consider enforcing risk-based deposit insurance. Default Swaps  Toender Bank, which less than two months ago raised $5 million in new hybrid capital, was declared insolvent after the FSA’s inspection revealed 319 million kroner ($55 million) in bad loans. Sydbank A/S (SYDB), Denmark’s third-largest listed lender, took over the bank’s 18,000 customers and assets, though it won’t assume Toender’s hybrid or supplementary capital.  Credit-default swaps on Denmark rose to the highest level in almost two weeks when markets opened Nov. 5. The 57-member index of listed Danish bank stocks fell to its second lowest level in almost three months.

2012-06-04,,Caixa Geral de Depósitos (Portugal),0,"Portuguese banks turn to bailout fund for capital. Three leading Portuguese banks will draw on funds provided under the country's 78 billion euro ($96 billion) international bailout to meet tough new capital requirements as they struggle with the country's debt crisis.  Millennium bcp, Portugal's largest private bank in terms of assets, said on Monday it would draw 3 billion euros from the bailout fund's ""recapitalisation line"", while Banco BPI will draw 1.2 billion. State-owned Caixa Geral de Depositos will draw 1.65 billion.  The move by the three banks was expected and leaves only Banco Espirito Santo (BES) among Portugal's leading banks without state funding. BES has said it does not intend to draw on the recapitalisation line after having raised 1 billion euros from shareholders.  ""These operations will put Portuguese banks in a solid position compared with other European banks,"" Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar told a press conference as he presented the results of the fourth review of the country's bailout.  Under Portugal's bailout by the European Union and IMF, 12 billion euros was set aside for the recapitalisation of its banks. Capital injections to the sector will be carried out through special bonds convertible into equity, known as Cocos, which must be paid back in five years.  If not repaid, the state would end up holding about 33 percent of BPI and 40 percent of Millennium, according to Andre Rodrigues, an analyst at Caixa Banco de Investimento.  Portugal's banks have effectively been cut off from European capital markets for nearly two years since the country's debt crisis broke out and it entered its worst recession since the 1970s under the weight of sweeping austerity measures.  Shares in Banco BPI surged on the fact that the capital raising was relatively small, while Millennium slipped on the large size of its hike.  HIGHER AMOUNT  ""The market believes that BPI will be able to turn the situation around and return the money to the state in the five years under the plan,"" said Emanuel Vieira, a trader at brokerage Golden Broker. ""In the case of Millennium there were already doubts as it is a much higher amount.""  Shares in Millennium were 1 percent lower at 0.099 euros per share and BPI was 7 percent higher at 0.408 euros per share.  Under the bailout terms, the country's banks need to have core Tier 1 capital ratios of 10 percent of assets by the end of this year.  Millennium said it would raise a further 500 million euros through a rights issue to shareholders, while Banco BPI will raise another 200 million through the same route.  An analyst who asked not to be named said shareholders were likely to subscribe to both Millennium and BPI's capital hikes. Angolan oil company Sonangol is a large shareholder in Millennium and is likely to participate, the analyst said.  Millennium said in a statement the capital plan was prepared on the basis it would have to take a further provision of around 450 million euros for risks linked to the deteriorating economic situation in Greece, where it has a unit.  Many economists have said Portugal is likely to need more funding for its bailout, or to extend its terms. Still, the finance minister said on Monday the country had passed the fourth review of the economy under the bailout and the programme remained unchanged... * Millennium bcp to draw 3 billion euros from bailout fund  * Banco BPI dto raw 1.2 bln, Caixa Geral de Depositos 1.65 bln  * Millennium to raise further 500 million euros via rights issue  * Banco BPI to raise another 200 mln.",Reuters,http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/04/portugal-millennium-idUSL5E8H43EA20120604,Portugal,Portugal,,36.091091,-18.727655

2010-09-30,,Allied Irish Bank (Ireland),Ireland to Take Majority Ownership of AIB in Bailout,"The Irish government will take majority ownership of Allied Irish Banks Plc in its second bailout of the lender, Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said. The bank will seek to raise 5.4 billion euros ($7.3 billion) in a November stock offering. Ireland’s National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission, which is guaranteeing the sale, may buy as much as 3.7 billion euros of stock and convert 1.7 billion euros of preference shares, the Dublin-based lender said in a statement today. “In the current stressed market conditions, the bank is unlikely to be able to conduct a traditional privately underwritten transaction,” Lenihan said in a statement today. “As a consequence of these actions it is likely that the state will hold a majority shareholding in AIB.” Ireland’s banks are raising capital after bad debts surged as a decade-long real estate boom collapsed. The government said today the cost of rescuing the country’s lenders may jump to as much as 50 billion euros. The rising cost of the bailouts prompted Standard & Poor’s to downgrade Ireland’s credit rating last month and has pushed up the country’s borrowing costs. Allied Irish’s Managing Director Colm Doherty and Chairman Dan O’Connor will both step down. “The big surprise is the increased capital number for Allied Irish,” said Sebastian Orsi, an analyst with Merrion Capital, a Dublin-based securities firm. “The government could end up with over 90 percent of the group, subject to investor take-up of the planned stock sale to shareholders.” Shares Tumble The stock fell 8.2 percent to 51 euro cents at the 5:10 p.m. close of trading in Dublin. The new shares will be sold for 50 cents each, the lender said. Bank of Ireland Plc rose 8.8 percent to 62 cents after the central bank said it didn’t need any extra cash. “This is very disappointing, particularly regarding Allied Irish,” said Ciaran Callaghan, an analyst with NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin. “Overall, it’s quite worrying that banking costs continue to rise.” The Anglo Irish bailout may cost Ireland’s government more than 35 billion euros, Standard & Poor’s credit analyst Trevor Cullinan said this month.",Bloomberg,http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-30/ireland-to-take-majority-ownership-of-aib-in-bailout-update1-.html,"Dublin, Ireland",Ireland,Dublin,53.34807,-6.248274

(Iceland),Icelandic bank Straumur-Burdaras slides into state ownership,"  Straumur-Burdaras Investment Bank, the last survivor among Iceland's four main banks, fell into the hands of the beleaguered country's government today after its funding dried up.  Like its peers Glitnir, Landsbanki and Kaupthing, Straumur has been nationalised after an aggressive expansion in Europe, where it lent more money than it could afford during the credit bubble. The bank lost €699m (£640m) in 2008.  Straumur lent to companies that have since gone bust, including UK airline XL Leisure Group. The UK, where the bank employs about 136 staff, accounted for about 16% of the company's loan book, behind the Nordic countries, which represented a combined 38%, according to the company.  Iceland's financial regulator, the Financial Supervisory Authority, suspended the bank's board, while chief executive, William Fall, who joined Straumur in 2007 from Bank of America, resigned.  Reykjavík-based Straumur specialises in investment banking services to small and medium-sized companies, expanding into riskier areas such as leveraged lending or proprietary trading. Like its Icelandic rivals, Straumur opened offices in some of the European countries that have been hardest hit by the global credit crunch, including the UK, Denmark and the Czech Republic. Almost three-quarters of the bank's client income was generated outside Iceland, according to Straumur's website.  In Britain, Straumur bought Teather & Greenwood, a mid-cap stockbroker and financial adviser in October 2008, recruiting 60 corporate finance and research staff. Straumur also bought 50% of Stamford Partners, an investment banking firm based in London and Amsterdam, in 2006.  The bank's operations grew rapidly over the past three years. It employed 109 people in 2006 and about 600 three years later, its website shows. The bank's loan portfolio surged by 161% in 2006 and almost doubled in 2007.  Straumur's major shareholders, as of February 3, included Samson Global Holdings, an investment vehicle controlled by Icelandic multimillionaire Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, also a former main shareholder at Landsbanki. Samson had a 34% stake in Straumur, according to a recent press release.  Struggling companies that have borrowed from Icelandic banks are under threat as the country's government has started to call in loans. Baugur, the investment company that held stakes in well-known retail chains such as House of Fraser and food chain Iceland, was put into administration after its government-controlled lender, Landsbanki, began a process to recover assets.

The republic's government made its move to stop runs on the bank's dep-osits and shares that could have caused it to implode. Confidence in Anglo Irish has collapsed since the resignations of its chairman, Sean Fitzpatrick, and chief executive, David Drumm, last month after it revealed that Mr FitzPatrick had concealed €87m (£78m) of loans from the bank. Brian Lenihan, the finance minister, said: ""The funding position of the bank has weakened and unacceptable practices that took place within it have caused serious reputational damage to the bank at a time when overall market sentiment to-wards it was negative.""

Anglo Irish shares fell 10.8 per cent yesterday to €0.20, from a high of more than €17 in May 2007. The government's reluctant nationalisation of Anglo Irish is a major blow to the republic, the self-styled Celtic tiger whose rapid economic growth was heavily dependent on rising property prices. Anglo Irish was for a long time one of the darlings of the banking sector but confidence in the company collapsed on fears about its heavy exposure to commercial property and precarious wholesale market funding.

In particular, the measure is necessary to remedy the severe liquidity problems of Banco Privado Português and to preserve confidence in the financial markets, and is limited to the minimum required to achieve this objective. The Commission has therefore concluded that the measure can be authorised because it is an adequate means to remedy a serious disturbance of the Portuguese economy and as such is in line with Article 87.3.b of the EC Treaty. Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said: ""The Commission is satisfied that that the state guarantee for the loan to Banco Privado Português is necessary as a temporary rescue measure and would not give rise to disproportionate distortions of competition within the Single Market.""  On 5 December 2008 Portugal issued a guarantee, assisted by collaterals, on a €450 million loan granted by six Portuguese banks to Banco Privado Português. Although the measure was initially notified on 5 December, complete information was only provided to the Commission on 20 February 2009.  The loan has a duration of six months and can only be used by Banco Privado Português to face its liabilities as registered in the balance sheet on 24 November 2008.

The agreement, reached late on Tuesday, nationalises the last big independent Baltic bank, taking the state’s stake up from 51 per cent, and marks the collapse of the empire of Valery Kargin and Viktor Krasovitsky, once Latvia’s richest men. Mr Kargin and Mr Krasovitsky, Russian Jews with good Communist party connections, won the first private licence in the Soviet Union to trade in hard currency in 1990. After Latvia achieved independence in 1991 they built a lucrative business servicing Russian capital flight. Parex survived three Latvian banking crises during the 1990s but it was powerless to withstand the impact of the credit crisis and the Baltic recession.

Austrian broadcaster ORF reported on Sunday. The state will take over the 51 percent owned by Austria's Volksbank and the 49 percent owned by Franco-Belgian financial services firm Dexia (DEXI.BR), ORF reported without citing its source. Kommunalkredit was not immediately available for comment. A finance ministry spokesman told Reuters last week that it was considering taking an equity stake in Kommunalkredit, a key financier of Austrian states and municipalities that has 20 billion euros ($25.55 billion) in bonds outstanding. Talks were proceeding about how big such a stake could be and what form of equity would be injected in the bank, which faces a liquidity squeeze because it relies on wholesale funding to refinance its loan book, the spokesman said last week. Kommunalkredit said last weekend it had started talks with the finance ministry about measures under the country's recently enacted banking stability package.

2008-11-02,,Banco Português de Negócios (BPN) (Portugal),0,"Portugal’s Socialist government on Sunday announced plans to nationalise a local bank that has run up accumulated losses of €700m ($891m, £554m) and faces an “imminent breakdown” of its ability to meet payments. The government said it would also make up to €4bn available to Portuguese banks to strengthen their capital ratios, in line with state-backed recapitalisation programmes recently announced in several other countries. The funds would be provided in the form of preference shares.

He said the government had decided instead to nationalise the bank, which has net assets of about €8bn, to ensure depositors were fully protected. Vitor Constâncio, governor of the central bank, said that as part of the €4bn scheme, the minimum Tier 1 solvency ratio for Portuguese banks would be lifted to 8 per cent, from a previous implied level of 7 per cent. Mr Teixeira dos Santos said the government would help Portuguese banks recapitalise to ensure they were not placed at a disadvantage to banks in other European countries were similar programmers had already been launched. State-owned Caixa Geral de Depósitos, the country’s biggest bank by deposits, would take over the management of BPN, he added. “All BPN customers can rest assures their deposits are safe,” he said after an extraordinary cabinet meeting. The nationalisation of BPN will be the first government intervention in a bank since a wave of state takeovers that followed the overthrow of Portugal’s rightwing regime in 1974. The minister said the roots of BPN’s difficulties had their origin in financial operations of “dubious legality” and were not directly related to the global financial crisis. However, the international credit crunch had exacerbated its problems in recent months.

The government moved quickly to use sweeping powers over the country's banks granted in the Reykjavik parliament last night. The board of directors at Landsbanki has been dismissed and the bank put into receivership. The government has also loaned €500m to Kaupthing, the biggest bank in Iceland.  UK savers trying to access their Landsbanki-run Icesave accounts this morning were faced with a message telling them the bank was unable to process requests for deposits or withdrawals. Icesave offered competitive rates and has more than 200,000 accounts in the UK. The first €22,000 (roughly £17,000) held in the accounts is secured under an Icelandic compensation scheme, and the remainder up to £50,000 is guaranteed by the British government.  On state radio, commerce and banking minister Bjorgvin Sigurdsson sought to reassure people in Iceland that the bank would remain open and continue to run as normal.  The Landsbanki chairman and a large shareholder in the bank is Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, the owner of West Ham United football club.  In an address broadcast on Icelandic television last night, prime minister Geir Haarde announced plans to rush through the emergency bill, supported by opposition parties, allowing the government to push through mergers between the battered banks or force them into bankruptcy. ""We were faced with the real possibility that the national economy would be sucked into the global banking swell and end in national bankruptcy,"" he said.  There was some confusion about whether the loan from Russia had been agreed. Iceland's central bank said in a statement that it had been informed by the Russian ambassador that Iceland would be given a €4bn loan and that it had been agreed by the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin. The bank said Haarde had approached the Russians about a loan some months ago.  But the Russian state news agency separately quoted the deputy finance minister, Dmitry Pankin, as saying there had been no formal approach from Iceland and that no decision had been made. The Icelandic bank then updated its statement to say that negotiations would begin ""in the next few days"".

The largest private bank in bankruptcy was estimated at 18.7 million Levs. During the bidding the state offered a price of 25 million Levs, while the last offer of the private firm was 14,820 million Levs. In five days the Treasury again asked the price to be paid by offsetting receivables by the state budget. The trustees Javor Kamburov and Teodora Stoyanova submitted a protocol for approval of the buyer to be the state with a delay of nearly a month. On January 17 the judge Alexei Ivanov issued a ruling, which refused to recognize the Finance Ministry to be the buyer - with the argument that it has not paid the price in cash.

2012-07-16,,Caja de Ahorros del Mediterráneo (Spain),,"The situation of Spain's troubled financial sector is well-documented; however, news of a Spanish bank being liquidated has virtually gone unnoticed by the international press. CAM, short for Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo, will officially enter a liquidation process following a general assembly meeting held last Monday. In reality, the entity's core banking business was acquired by Banco Sabadell, meaning that only remnants of the business, mostly social programs, are being liquidated. (Let's call it a partial liquidation of a Spanish 'caja'.) The main concern, however, is that bank customers are suffering losses as a result of the bank's failure, and that is something that should not be taken lightly. At CAM's general assembly meeting, members voted against the FROB's (Spain's Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring) proposal to amortize outstanding non-voting shares ('cuotas participativas') to zero, claiming that the move would be detrimental to thousands of customers.
